# The Logbook

I've always liked games and the idea of building one myself one day.
I had an idea for a text-based game, and one day I figured, why not try building it?
And so, we have The Logbook. Currently, it's nothing more than a combat test page, 
allowing you to fight in a turn-based active time battle. I wanted a more robust text adventure, 
rather than your standard "read story, pick choices." I opted for a more 
RPG focused approach. Currently, it boasts the ability to cast spells and 
drink potions that can add various effects to yourself or the enemies you target. 
This is very much a work in progress.

## Playing the game
You can play The Logbook [here](https://flint64.github.io/logbook/combat-test).
The current version allows you to fight in a simple combat with 3 random enemies.
You have to 7 different potions and 2 spells, some of which have lingering
effects such as poison or burn damage. Once the battle is over, win or lose,
if you wish to play again, simply refresh the page and 3 new enemies will
be picked at random, and your stats/items will be refreshed.

The game plays equally well on both mobile and desktop screen sizes, and if
you're on a desktop, you can also use the numbers on your keyboard to select
menu options! 

## The Story
There is currently no formal story in this version of The Logbook, but if
you navigate to [the home page](https://flint64.github.io/logbook/) you
can get a bit of a preview of what is to come in later versions, starting
with the Path of the Sacrifice.
